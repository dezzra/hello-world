# hello-world 

I've always loved word puzzles, especially cryptograms.  So I thought it would be interesting to learn about cryptography.

In August this year, I searched /r/cryptography for some ideas on where to start learning. 

The subreddit recommended "Cryptography I" on Coursera, so I enrolled. The course is excellent, but quickly became too complicated.

So I tried reading the e-book, "Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python." Simpler, but it used a lot of python code that I couldn't understand.

Next, I enrolled in "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" on Coursera. This course is amazing, and I'm on week 5 of 9. But it leaves out Python coding details that are not directly involved in the course projects. 

So I just finished reading "Coding for Beginners in Easy Steps." It was pretty basic, but provided information in a structured format.

I've also been playing around with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and reading "Raspberry Pi 3 in Easy Steps." For my first project, I want to implement a motion-sensing, recording camera. I plan to buy myself the required materials for Christmas. 

Now, I'm reading "Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain."  What an amazing book. I thought I had to learn C++ to understand the code, but it also provides examples in Python. 

That's where I am today. The book advised me to download the "pybitcointools" library from Github.  Unfortunately, it seems this library is no longer maintained. I downloaded the file, but it doesn't seem to do anything. 

So now, I'm learning how to use Github using its "Hello World" guide, to make sure I'm not missing something. 

Whee!
